Database Schema Design: Understanding how to design a database schema to store data efficiently is crucial for organizing data effectively and optimizing database performance. This involves considering factors such as normalization, denormalization, and indexing strategies.

Table Creation: Creating tables with appropriate data types and constraints is fundamental in defining the structure of a database. This skill involves selecting suitable data types for each column based on the nature of the data being stored and applying constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints to enforce data integrity.

Data Manipulation: The ability to manipulate data, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records, is essential for managing the content of a database. This skill involves writing SQL queries to perform various operations on the data stored in tables.

Primary Key and Foreign Key Constraints: Enforcing data integrity through the use of primary and foreign key constraints ensures that relationships between tables are maintained and that data remains consistent. Understanding how to define and manage these constraints is crucial for preventing orphaned records and maintaining referential integrity.

SQL Syntax: Learning various SQL commands and syntax for database manipulation is fundamental for interacting with relational databases. This includes understanding commands such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER TABLE, and CREATE TABLE, as well as SQL expressions, functions, and clauses.

Database Management: Managing schemas, tables, and relationships within a database requires knowledge of database management techniques and tools. This includes tasks such as creating, modifying, and dropping database objects, as well as managing users, permissions, and backups.

Data Import: Importing data from external sources into a database for analysis or storage is a common task in database management. This skill involves understanding how to use SQL commands or database tools to import data from various file formats or external databases into target tables.
